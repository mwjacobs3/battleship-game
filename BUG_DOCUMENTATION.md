## Bugs Fixed in Initial Development

### 1. Board State Mutation Bug
**Severity:** High  
**Category:** State Management  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
Initial implementation directly mutated board state arrays instead of creating new copies, causing React to not detect changes and fail to re-render components.

**Symptoms:**
- Ships would appear to place but not render
- Game state updates were inconsistent
- Re-renders were skipped

**Root Cause:**  
Using `setPlayerBoard(playerBoard)` after directly modifying the array violated React's immutability principle.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Before (Buggy):
playerBoard[row][col] = shipIndex;
setPlayerBoard(playerBoard);

// After (Fixed):
const newBoard = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(playerBoard));
newBoard[row][col] = shipIndex;
setPlayerBoard(newBoard);
```

**Prevention:** Always create new object/array references when updating React state.

### 2. Infinite Loop in AI Ship Placement
**Severity:** High  
**Category:** Game Logic  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
AI ship placement could enter infinite loop if unable to find valid placement.

**Fix Applied:**
Added attempt counter with escape condition:
```javascript
let attempts = 0;
while (!placed && attempts < 100) {
  // placement logic
  attempts++;
}
```

---

### 3. Duplicate Shot Detection Missing
**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** Game Logic  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
Players could shoot the same cell multiple times without validation.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
const shotKey = `${row},${col}`;
if (playerShots.includes(shotKey)) {
  setMessage('You already shot here!');
  return;
}
```

---

### 4. Ship Sinking Detection Bug
**Severity:** High  
**Category:** Game Logic  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
Ship sinking logic didn't correctly count hits per ship.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
const shipHits = newPlayerShots.filter(shot => {
  const [r, c] = shot.split(',').map(Number);
  return aiBoard[r] && aiBoard[r][c] === shipIndex;
});

if (shipHits.length === SHIPS[shipIndex].size) {
  // Ship is sunk
}
```

---

### 5. Race Condition in AI Turn
**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** Async Logic  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
AI turn could fire before player shot state was updated.

**Fix Applied:**
Pass updated shots directly to AI turn:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  aiTurn(newPlayerShots);
}, 1000);
```

---

### 6. AI Target Mode Not Resetting
**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** AI Logic  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
AI remained in targeting mode after sinking a ship.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
if (shipHits.length === SHIPS[shipIndex].size) {
  newTargetMode.active = false;
  newTargetMode.hits = [];
}
```

---

### 7. Boundary Check Missing in Ship Placement
**Severity:** High  
**Category:** Validation  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
Ships could be placed beyond board boundaries.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
if (orientation === 'horizontal') {
  if (col + size > GRID_SIZE) return false;
} else {
  if (row + size > GRID_SIZE) return false;
}
```

---

### 8. Game State Not Checking Before Actions
**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** State Management  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
Actions could be performed in wrong game states.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
const handlePlayerShot = (row, col) => {
  if (gameState !== 'playing') return;
  // ... rest of logic
}
```

---

### 9. Board Initialization Race Condition
**Severity:** Low  
**Category:** Initialization  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
Component could render before boards were initialized.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
const [playerBoard, setPlayerBoard] = useState(null);
const [aiBoard, setAiBoard] = useState(null);

if (!playerBoard || !aiBoard) {
  return <div>Loading game...</div>;
}
```

## Bugs Fixed in Code Review Session (October 2025)

### 10. Shallow Copy Bug in AI Targeting Mode
**Severity:** High  
**Category:** State Management  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
AI targeting mode used shallow copy when updating state, causing mutation of the original `hits` array.

**Root Cause:**
```javascript
const newTargetMode = { ...aiTargetMode };  // Shallow copy
newTargetMode.hits.push({ row, col });      // Mutates original array!
```

The spread operator `{ ...aiTargetMode }` only creates a shallow copy, so `newTargetMode.hits` still references the same array as `aiTargetMode.hits`. When `push()` is called, it mutates the original state.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
const newTargetMode = {
  active: true,
  hits: [...aiTargetMode.hits, { row, col }]  // Deep copy of array
};
```

**Prevention:** When copying objects containing arrays or nested objects, ensure all nested structures are also copied.

### 11. Silent AI Ship Placement Failure
**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** Error Handling  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
If AI ship placement failed after 100 attempts, the ship was silently skipped with no error logging or user notification. This could result in AI having fewer than 5 ships.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
if (!placed) {
  console.warn(`Failed to place ${ship.name} after ${attempts} attempts`);
}
```

**Impact:** Helps developers debug board initialization issues and identify potential problems with ship placement algorithm.

---

### 12. Unused Code - Direction Field
**Severity:** Low  
**Category:** Code Quality  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Description:**  
The `aiTargetMode` state object had a `direction` field that was initialized, set to null, but never actually used in any game logic.

**Fix Applied:**  
Removed the `direction` field from:
- Initial state declaration
- All state updates
- Reset game function

**Impact:** Cleaner code, reduced state complexity.

---

## Testing & Verification

All bugs were verified through:
1. ✅ Manual gameplay testing
2. ✅ Browser console monitoring (no errors)
3. ✅ State mutation verification
4. ✅ Edge case testing (boundary conditions, full boards, etc.)

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always use deep copies for nested state structures** - Shallow copying objects with array properties leads to subtle mutation bugs
2. **Add error handling even for "impossible" cases** - Silent failures make debugging extremely difficult
3. **Remove unused code immediately** - Dead code creates confusion and maintenance burden
4. **Test state updates thoroughly** - React's immutability requirements mean careful attention to how state is copied and modified
5. **Document bugs as they're fixed** - Proper documentation helps prevent regression and educates future developers

## Code Quality Improvements Made

- ✅ Fixed all state mutation bugs
- ✅ Added proper error logging
- ✅ Removed dead code
- ✅ Improved code maintainability
- ✅ Enhanced documentation structure

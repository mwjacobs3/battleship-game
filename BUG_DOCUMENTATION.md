## Bugs Found and Fixed

### 1. **Board State Mutation Bug**
**Severity:** High  
**Category:** State Management

**Description:**  
Initial implementation directly mutated the board state arrays instead of creating new copies, causing React to not detect changes and fail to re-render components properly.

**Symptoms:**
- Ships would appear to place but not render
- Game state updates were inconsistent
- Re-renders were skipped

**Root Cause:**  
Using `setPlayerBoard(playerBoard)` after directly modifying the array violates React's immutability principle.

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Before (Buggy):
playerBoard[row][col] = shipIndex;
setPlayerBoard(playerBoard);

// After (Fixed):
const newBoard = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(playerBoard));
newBoard[row][col] = shipIndex;
setPlayerBoard(newBoard);
// Added attempt counter with escape condition
let attempts = 0;
while (!placed && attempts < 100) {
  // placement logic
  attempts++;
}const shotKey = `${row},${col}`;
if (playerShots.includes(shotKey)) {
  setMessage('You already shot here!');
  return;
}// Count hits for specific ship
const shipHits = newPlayerShots.filter(shot => {
  const [r, c] = shot.split(',').map(Number);
  return aiBoard[r][c] === shipIndex;
});

if (shipHits.length === SHIPS[shipIndex].size) {
  // Ship is sunk
}
setTimeout(() => {
  aiTurn(newPlayerShots);
}, 1000);
if (shipHits.length === SHIPS[shipIndex].size) {
  // Ship sunk - reset target mode
  newTargetMode.active = false;
  newTargetMode.hits = [];
  newTargetMode.direction = null;
}
if (orientation === 'horizontal') {
  if (col + size > GRID_SIZE) return false;
} else {
  if (row + size > GRID_SIZE) return false;
}
const handlePlayerShot = (row, col) => {
  if (gameState !== 'playing') return;
  // ... rest of logic
}
// Changed initial state from [] to null
const [playerBoard, setPlayerBoard] = useState(null);
const [aiBoard, setAiBoard] = useState(null);

// Added loading state check
if (!playerBoard || !aiBoard) {
  return <div>Loading game...</div>;
}
